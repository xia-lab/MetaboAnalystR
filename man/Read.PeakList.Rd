\description{
This function reads peak list files and fills the data into a dataSet object.  
For NMR peak lists, the input should be formatted as two-columns containing numeric values (ppm, int).
Further, this function will change ppm to mz, and add a dummy 'rt'.
For MS peak data, the lists can be formatted as two-columns (mz, int), in which case the function will add a dummy 'rt', or
the lists can be formatted as three-columns (mz, rt, int).
