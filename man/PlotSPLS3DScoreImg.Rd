}
\arguments{
\item{mSetObj}{Input name of the created mSet Object}

\item{imgName}{Input a name for the plot}

\item{format}{Select the image format, "png", or "pdf".}

\item{dpi}{Input the dpi. If the image format is "pdf", users need not define the dpi. For "png" images, 
the default dpi is 72. It is suggested that for high-resolution images, select a dpi of 300.}

\item{width}{Input the width, there are 2 default widths, the first, width = NULL, is 10.5.
The second default is width = 0, where the width is 7.2. Otherwise users can input their own width.}

\item{inx1}{Numeric, indicate the number of the principal component for the x-axis of the loading plot.}

\item{inx2}{Numeric, indicate the number of the principal component for the y-axis of the loading plot.}

\item{inx3}{Numeric, indicate the number of the principal component for the z-axis of the loading plot.}

\item{angl}{Input the angle}
}
\description{
This function creates two 3D sPLS-DA score plots, the first is static for Analysis Report purposes, as well as 
an interactive 3D plot using the plotly R package. The 3D score plot is saved in the created mSetObj (mSetObj$imgSet$splsda.3d).
To view the score plot, if the name of your mSetObj is mSet, enter "mSet$imgSet$splsda.3d" to view the interactive score plot.
