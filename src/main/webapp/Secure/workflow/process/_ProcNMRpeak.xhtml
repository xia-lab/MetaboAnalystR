                    Each NMR peak list file should contain two columns of numeric values - the first column must be chemical shift (ppm), and the second must be the intensity of the peak.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    The first line of the file should be column labels (i.e. ppm, int).   
                </li>
                <li>
                    This program groups peaks based on their ppm values using a moving window of 0.03 ppm and a step of 0.015 ppm. 
                    Peaks within the same peak group will be aligned to their median ppm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For each peak group, if more than one peak is detected from the same sample, they will be replaced by their sum. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If a peak group contains peaks from less than half of the samples of both classes, it will be excluded from alignment.
